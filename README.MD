This repository contains compiled binaries of FORM, a computer algebra system developed by Jos Vermaseren. The original FORM repository can be found here

https://github.com/vermaseren/form

**This is not an official provider for FORM binaries and the owners of this repository are not related to FORM or its developers in any way**. 

The binaries available here are intended for the users of FormLink, a Mathematica package that allows to use FORM from a Mathematica session. We provide the binaries as a courtesy to those who might not be able to compile FORM from source themselves and hence would not be able to use FormLink. All the others should compile their binaries from the source code in the official FORM repository.

By downloading any binaries from here, you acknowledge that you have read the **conditions for the use of FORM** laid out here

http://www.nikhef.nl/~form/license/license.html

and that you agree to follow them. Otherwise, using the binaries would constitute a copyright violation!

Windows binary of FORM requires cygwin1.dll. This dll (and its source code) are available here
